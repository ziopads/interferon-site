#### ethos
We work with technology to create aesthetic experiences. Our approach is interdisciplinary and collaborative, synthesizing our skills in coding, music, design, and pedagogy. We produce self-initiated and commissioned works that range from interactive media installations, generative design, and data visualization to audio composition, production, and performance. Through a variety of digital and analog tools, we explore the aesthetic potential of technology.

We take our name from the proteins the body produces in response to an infection. Named for their ability to interfere with viral proliferation, these proteins govern the intercellular signaling that regulates immune response. They are the body's most important defense against pathogens. While such a biological mechanism might seem far removed from our work, we think it is an apposite metaphor for expressive technology. Even when it appears abstract or non-referential, creative work is fundamentally a form of social engagement, one that is foundational to our collective well-being.

network
interferon has grown out of the creative coding community where it first laid its roots by writing libraries, leading workshops, and giving talks on the topic of generative design. Our teaching and writing experience fosters inspiration and has created connections with galleries and creative spaces worldwide. We collaborate with other artists, agencies and professionals across disciplines such as dancers, musicians and architects, to merge interests and encourage new fields of development.

studio
Our studio is located in Denver. The space reflects the flexible nature of our work and allows for varying configurations to facilitate projects and develop new concepts. Our in-house workshop enables quick prototyping and encourages a collaborative working atmosphere. A rooftop terrace looks out over the city and often serves as a meeting place for our friends and collaborators.
