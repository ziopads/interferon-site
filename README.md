## studio
#### ethos
self-initiated and commissioned works that range from interactive media installations, generative design and dynamic visuals to data-driven narratives. Observations of our surroundings inspire us to explore the possibilities that lie between analog and digital fields to examine the relationship of humans and technology. Through an interdisciplinary and collaborative practice, the visual language of interferon is variable.

network
interferon has grown out of the creative coding community where it first laid its roots by writing libraries, leading workshops, and giving talks on the topic of generative design. Our teaching and writing experience fosters inspiration and has created connections with galleries and creative spaces worldwide. We collaborate with other artists, agencies and professionals across disciplines such as dancers, musicians and architects, to merge interests and encourage new fields of development.

studio
Our studio is located in one of Berlin's refurbished factory spaces in the heart of the vibrant neighborhood of Friedrichshain. The space reflects the flexible nature of our work and allows for varying configurations to facilitate projects and develop new concepts. Our in-house workshop enables quick prototyping and encourages a collaborative working atmosphere. A rooftop terrace looks out over the city and often serves as a meeting place for our friends and collaborators.
